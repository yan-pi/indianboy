> **TL;DR:** Split keyboards let you type at shoulder width, reducing wrist strain. Start with an open source design like Corne or Lily58, go low-profile (Choc) if you want portability, and invest time in learning layers, they're essential for small boards.

## The Problem

I used to think wrist pain was just part of being a developer. 
Eight hours of coding, sore wrists, tense shoulders.
Normal, right?

Then I get into [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2bJkzIaPE) from Ben Valek, were he goes into the topic of ergonomics and split keyboards, and i started thinking about it, i was already using keyboard first tools (like neovim, cli and tui to do major of my job).

Then I watched myself type.
My wrists were bent inward, shoulders hunched forward, fingers reaching awkwardly for keys (since i have small hands), some keys I pressed sometimes with one hand, sometimes with the other, everything seems to be wrong.

Found that the standard keyboard layout dates back to typewriters and we're still usign that shit.

Something had to change.

## Why Split Keyboards

Here's the thing about regular keyboards: they force your hands together. Your shoulders roll forward. Your wrists angle inward. Do that for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, and your body will let you know.

Split keyboards fix this by letting you place each half at shoulder width. Your arms stay parallel. Your wrists stay straight. It sounds simple because it is. (Not really, it depends on how deep you want to get into)

But there's more to it. Most split keyboards also use **column stagger** instead of row stagger. On a regular keyboard, each row is offset horizontally, a leftover from typewriter mechanics. Column stagger aligns keys vertically based on finger length. Your fingers move up and down naturally instead of reaching diagonally.

## Choosing Your Path, Build vs Buy

This is where it gets interesting. You have three options:

### Open Source Designs

The community has created dozens of tested, refined keyboard designs. 
The most popular:
- **Corne (Crkbd)** : 42 keys, minimal, the one I use daily. Forces you to learn layers.
- **Lily58** : 58 keys, more forgiving. I built one of these first.
- **Sofle** : Similar to Lily58 with rotary encoder support.

These are open source. The PCB files, firmware, and build guides are all free. You can order PCBs from JLCPCB or PCBWay for cheap. The catch? You need to source parts and solder.

you can search with this resources:

- [r/ErgoMechKeyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/)

### Commercial Options

If soldering isn't your thing, companies like **ZSA** make production-quality split keyboards:

- **Moonlander** : Full-featured, lots of keys, RGB, tenting built in
- **Voyager** : Their newer, more minimal option

Typeractive sells pre-built Corne and Lily58 keyboards as well.

- [typeractive](https://www.typeractive.com/)

You pay more, but you get a finished product with support and a nice configurator.

### The KiCad Path

If you really want to go deep, you can design your own. KiCad is free and open source. The community has tutorials for keyboard PCB design. I wouldn't recommend this as your first split, but it's there when you're ready to create something truly custom.

You can check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WXpGTIbxlQ) from Joe Scotto and the [Absolem Discord channel](https://discord.gg/v6rMHrAqKw).

**My take:** Start with an open source design. Buy a kit if you don't want to source parts yourself. Move to commercial if you value your time over money. Design your own when you've used enough keyboards to know exactly what you want.

## The Anatomy of a Split Keyboard

Before you buy or build, understand what you're choosing.

### High Profile vs Low Profile

This refers to the switches and keycaps.

- **MX-style (high profile)** : The standard. Taller switches, more key travel, louder. Huge variety of switches and keycaps available.
- **Choc (low profile)** : Kailh's low-profile switches. Shorter travel, quieter, more portable. Fewer keycap options, but the keyboard sits much lower on your desk.

I use Choc switches on my Corne. The low profile means I don't need a wrist rest, my hands just hover naturally. If you're coming from a laptop keyboard, low profile feels familiar.

### Thumb Clusters

This is the superpower of split keyboards. Instead of your thumbs doing nothing (or just hitting spacebar), they get their own cluster of keys.

On a Corne, each thumb has 3 keys. That's 6 extra keys in the most accessible position on the entire board. I use mine for:

- Space and Enter (the obvious ones)
- Layer switches
- Backspace
- Modifiers

Suddenly you're not stretching your pinky for Ctrl or reaching for Backspace. Your strongest, most dexterous fingers handle it.

### Column Stagger

Look at your fingers. They're different lengths. Column stagger accounts for this, the columns are offset vertically so each finger moves straight up and down. It feels weird for about a week. Then regular keyboards feel wrong.

## The Software Side

Hardware is half the story. The real magic happens in firmware.

### QMK vs ZMK

Two main options:

- **QMK** : The standard. Runs on wired keyboards. Incredibly powerful, great documentation, huge community.
- **ZMK** : Built for wireless. If you want Bluetooth, this is your choice. Slightly less mature but actively developed.

> Each firmware needs to be compatible with your keyboard's PCB and microcontroller. Check before you start.

I use ZMK because I wanted wireless. No regrets.
> Both are solid choices. but QMK has been around longer and has more resources.

### Layers: Essential for Small Boards

On a 42-key Corne, you don't have dedicated number keys, function keys, or a navigation cluster. They're all on layers.

Think of layers like Shift for your entire keyboard. Hold a key, and suddenly you're on a different layout. Release, and you're back.

My setup:

- **Base** : Letters, basic punctuation
- **Lower** : Numbers, arrows and Function keys
- **Raise** : Symbols, and math operators

![Raise layer - Symbols and math operators](/Screenshot%202026-01-23%20at%2018.00.52.png)

It takes about two weeks to build muscle memory. After that, you'll wonder why you ever wanted 104 keys.

### Homerow Mods: The Next Level

I haven't fully committed to these yet, but the concept is clever. Your home row keys (A, S, D, F, J, K, L, ;) become dual-function:

- Tap for the letter
- Hold for a modifier (Ctrl, Alt, Shift, Super)

So holding 'F' gives you Ctrl. Holding 'J' gives you Ctrl on the other hand. No more pinky stretching.

The challenge is timing. Set the hold threshold wrong and you'll get accidental modifiers while typing fast. The community has spent years tuning this. If you want to try, start with someone else's tested config.

## Finding Your Resting Position

You have the keyboard. Now where do you put it?

### Tenting and Tilting

Tenting angles the inner edge of each half upward. Instead of your palms facing down, they face slightly inward, like you're about to clap. This is the natural resting position for your hands.

Tenting depends of the case that you are using, you have a lot of setups that you can use for tenting.
Even 10-15 degrees makes a difference.

Tilting is the front-to-back angle. Contrary to what keyboard feet suggest, you probably want **negative tilt**, the back lower than the front. This keeps your wrists straighter.

### Wrist Rests: Maybe Not

Hot take: with a low-profile split keyboard and proper positioning, you might not need wrist rests. Your hands should hover, with your forearms doing the support work.

If you do use them, rest your palms, not your wrists. And don't rest while actively typing, only during pauses.

### Keyboard Placement

Put each half directly in front of its corresponding shoulder. Yes, this feels absurdly wide at first. Your mouse goes between them or to the side, depending on how often you use it.

## A Quick Note on Standing Desks

Standing complements split keyboards well. When you stand, you're more likely to keep your shoulders back and arms at the right angle.

The key is alternating. Stand for a while, sit for a while. Neither position is meant to be held for 8 hours.

## My Setup

For reference, here's what I actually use:

- **Keyboard:** Corne with Kailh Choc switches (low profile, linear)
- **Previous:** Custom-built Lily58 with Choc, great for learning, but I wanted fewer keys
- **Firmware:** ZMK for wireless
- **Keycaps:** MBK profile (low profile, sculpted)
- **Tenting:** Since my splitkb is low profile, I dont use tenting (might add magsafe stands later)

The journey from Lily58 to Corne taught me that fewer keys isn't a limitation, it's a feature. Every key is within easy reach. Nothing is wasted.

## What I Learned

After going through multiple builds and configurations:

1. **Start with more keys, not fewer.** Lily58 or Sofle for your first build. Go minimal later when you understand layers.

2. **Low profile is underrated.** Less fatigue, more portable, works great without a wrist rest.

3. **Layers take two weeks.** The learning curve is real but finite. Push through.

4. **Thumb clusters are the real upgrade.** More than split, more than column stagger. Your thumbs are wasted on regular keyboards.

5. **Open source first.** You'll learn more building than buying. And when something breaks, you can fix it.

6. **Your body will tell you.** Pain means something's wrong. Adjust position, adjust timing, adjust the keyboard itself. Don't ignore it.

The hardest part is the first two weeks. Your brain knows where keys should be, and they're not there anymore. Stick with it. The payoff is typing all day without pain.

That's worth some temporary frustration.
