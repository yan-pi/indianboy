## How to Start in Software Engineering

If you want to get into tech, stop collecting courses and start delivering. I won't give you a recipe — I'll tell you what actually works: visibility, accountability, and the ability to generate value.

## The Short Truth About Working for Free (It Was the Best Decision of My Life)

I worked for free for the company I'm now a partner in.
It wasn't charity — it was an investment.
Not everything is measured in dollars.

Sometimes what you gain is much more valuable:

- purpose (doing something that matters),
- mentorship (people to pull you forward),
- access (clients, investors, partners).

If you're going to give up salary, make it for something that truly pays off in the medium term: equity, direct product experience, networks you couldn't access otherwise.
Without that, it's exploitation.

## Build in Public: Why and How Without Nonsense

Talking about what you do doesn't help. Showing does. Building in public means exposing the process — mistakes, decisions, and metrics — and it works for three reasons:

- Attracts people who truly help (contributors, clients, partners).
- Creates permanent reputation: your work becomes your resume.
- Accelerates learning: fast real feedback.

How to start now:

- publish a public repo with an honest README;
- make commits explaining decisions;
- post short updates: what worked, what broke, what you'll change.

## Agency = Self-Management. Be Your Own Company Before Having One

"Having agency" isn't opening a business just for status — it's acting like an owner: defining scope, delivering on time, charging for value. This makes you scalable:

- Learn to negotiate scope and prioritize value over perfection.
- Make clear proposals, measure results, and communicate risks.
- Within companies: act like a mini-producer — whoever delivers, leads.

When your mindset becomes "agency," you can work as an employee, consultant, or start a business with less trauma.

## Entrepreneurship Without Myths: Real and Pragmatic Options

You don't need to become a unicorn. Real possibilities:

- Niche consulting (you solve problem X for clients Y).
- Simple product/SaaS with 5 paying clients before scaling.
- Open source + services (support, customization).

Taleb's rule applied: combine security with small bets with high upside. Don't put all your eggs in one basket.

## Working for Free with Criteria — Basic Rules

If you're going to work without getting paid, be strategic:

- clear objective (mentorship, equity, validation),
- time limit (3 months, 6 months, project X, delivery Y),
- return metric (introduction to X, first client, MVP, networking).

If you don't have these three, ask for payment.
Your time is a scarce asset — protect the downside.

## College: Use It for Networking, Don't Expect the Content to Employ You

College is still worth it — but not for the curriculum.
It's worth it for colleagues, multidisciplinary projects, and access to people.
Do projects with business, design, and sales people. Don't become hostage to professors. Learn on your own: real projects, internships, and open source.

## Open Source as a Career (Yes, You Can Make a Living From It)

Contributing publicly is the fastest path to technical reputation. Linus showed that contributing solves two problems: visibility and real maintenance experience. Strategy:

- start by solving small issues;
- write good documentation;
- choose an area and become a reference.

Open source can become a job, consulting, and product. Just don't think it's just posting and waiting; you'll usually have to maintain the work.

## TL;DR:

- antifragility: protect the downside, make many small bets.
- build and maintain: be ready for the dirty work; focus on the user.
- seek leverage (product, content, code that scales) and do what gives you pleasure.
- think product and market; don't deliver technology without a value model.
- community and practice: quality comes from code that's used, not theory.

act, publish, maintain, monetize (when it makes sense).

## Practical Checklist — Do This in the Next 4 Weeks

- Week 1 — Create a public repo with a README describing the real problem you solve.
- Week 2 — Make 1 PR to an open source project you use (documentation or simple bug).
- Week 3 — Post 2 "build in public" updates (decision you made; mistake you fixed).
- Week 4 — Schedule 5 contacts from college/work for 20 min each — ask about real problems.

Do this every month.

## Conclusion: Stop Waiting for Permission

College helps, mentorship helps, working for free sometimes helps — but nothing replaces showing work. (proof of work)

If you want to get into tech, turn yourself into a one-person agency: deliver, publish, maintain, and monetize when you can.
Be antifragile: protect yourself, risk small bets, and collect opportunities.
Stop waiting for permission. Start now.
