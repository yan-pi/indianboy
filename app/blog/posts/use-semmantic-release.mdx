## Introduction

This document should serve as a basis for semantic versioning and releases used in FESF projects. However, it is important to note that semantic versioning is a practice that can be used in any project, regardless of size or complexity.

## What is Semantic Versioning?

> Semantic Versioning is a set of rules for keeping track of versions in code development. It is a general model that all users can understand and use.

## Semantic Versioning Rules

### Version Number Format

The version number **MUST** follow the format `vX.Y.Z`, where:
- **X** = major version
- **Y** = minor version
- **Z** = patch version

Each part **MUST** increase numerically, with no leading zeros.

### Types of Versions

- **Patch Version (Z):** Incremented for backwards-compatible bug fixes.
- **Minor Version (Y):** Incremented for new backwards-compatible features or deprecation of features.
- **Major Version (X):** Incremented for changes that are not backwards-compatible.

### Pre-release Versions

May be indicated with a hyphen after the patch version, and have lower precedence than the normal version. **Examples:** `v1.0.0-alpha`, `v1.0.0-alpha.1`.

### Build Metadata

May be added after the version, preceded by a plus sign. Does not affect precedence. **Example:** `v1.0.0-alpha+001`.

### Version Precedence

Precedence **MUST** be calculated by comparing the version identifiers numerically (major, minor, patch, and pre-release). Pre-release versions have lower precedence than normal versions.

**Examples:**
- `v1.0.0 < 2.0.0`
- `v1.0.0-alpha < 1.0.0`

## Creating a New Release on GitHub

### 1. Navigate to the Repository
- On GitHub, go to the repository's `main page`.
- To the right of the file list, click on `Releases`.

### 2. Start a New Release
- At the top of the page, click on `Draft a new release`.

### 3. Choose a Tag for the Release
- Click the `Choose a tag` dropdown:
  - To use an `existing tag`, click the desired tag.
  - To create a `new tag`, enter a version number for the release and click
 `Create new tag`.
- If you created a new tag, select the `Target` menu and click the branch that contains the project you want to release.

### 4. Set the Previous Tag (Optional)
- Above the description field, select the `Previous tag` dropdown and click the tag that identifies the previous release.

### 5. Fill in the Release Title
- In the `Release title` field, enter a title for your release.

### 6. Generate Release Notes
- Above the description field, click on `Generate release notes`.
- Check the generated notes to ensure they include all (and only) the desired information.

### 7. Include Binary Files (Optional)
- To include binary files, such as compiled programs, drag and drop or manually select the files in the `binaries` box.

### 8. If it is a Beta/Alpha version, mark as Pre-Release.
- To notify users that the release is not ready for production and may be unstable, select `This is a pre-release`.

### 9. Set as Latest Release (Optional)
- Select `Set as latest release`. If not selected, the label will be assigned automatically based on semantic versioning.

### 11. Publish or Save Release Draft
- To publish your release, click on `Publish release`.
- To work on the release later, click on `Save draft`.

> **Note:** After saving or publishing, you can view your releases in the repository's release feed.
