### My Approach: Managing Personal Finances with Neovim, Copilot, and Monthly Ledger Books

Over the past months, I have adopted a practical and developer-friendly approach to personal finance management by leveraging my daily tools: Neovim, GitHub Copilot, and a system of monthly ledger books in Markdown.

#### Why This Stack?

- **Neovim**: As my primary editor, Neovim offers speed, extensibility, and a distraction-free environment. It allows me to quickly create, edit, and navigate my financial notes and ledgers.
- **GitHub Copilot**: Copilot acts as an AI assistant, helping automate calculations, generate summaries, and even suggest improvements to my financial tracking workflow.
- **Monthly Ledger Books**: By maintaining a separate Markdown file for each month, I can clearly track all transactions, recurring expenses, and financial goals. This structure makes it easy to review progress and adjust plans as needed.

#### Folder Organization

My setup uses a simple, logical folder structure:

```
30-RESOURCES/
  3002-LEDGER/
    300201-INDEX.md        # Ledger system overview and methodology
    300202-06-2025.md      # June 2025 ledger
    300202-07-2025.md      # July 2025 ledger
    300202-08-2025.md      # August 2025 ledger
```

Each monthly file contains:

- A summary of objectives and reserve goals
- A Markdown table logging all transactions (date, description, amount, running balance)
- Calculations for value gaps and recovery plans
- Monthly spending and savings targets
- Notes on recurring expenses and installment purchases

#### Example: Monthly Ledger Entry

```markdown
| Date       | Description            | Amount  | Balance |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| 2025-08-01 | Opening Balance        | 0.00    | 0.00    |
| 2025-08-01 | Parcel Purchase (1/10) | -454.40 | -454.40 |
| 2025-08-01 | Disney+                | -50.00  | -504.40 |
| 2025-08-01 | Gamepass               | -70.00  | -574.40 |
```

#### How It Works

1. **Monthly Ledger Files**: Each month gets its own Markdown file, where I log every transaction, categorize expenses, and calculate running balances.
2. **Financial Planning**: At the start of each month, I set spending and savings targets, and list all known fixed and variable expenses.
3. **Continuous Review**: I update the ledger daily or weekly, using Copilot to help with calculations and summaries.
4. **Retrospective**: At the end of the month, I review my progress, analyze spending patterns, and plan for the next month.

#### Benefits Experienced

- **Increased Awareness**: Logging every transaction makes me more conscious of my spending habits.
- **Better Planning**: Setting explicit monthly goals helps me prioritize savings and control unnecessary expenses.
- **Immediate Feedback**: With just two months of consistent tracking, I already notice improved discipline and financial clarity.
- **Developer Workflow**: Using tools I already love (Neovim, Markdown, Git), the process feels natural and integrated into my daily routine.

#### Conclusion

Combining Neovim, Copilot, and monthly ledger books has transformed my approach to personal finance. This workflow is simple, transparent, and highly customizableâ€”perfect for anyone who prefers text-based tools and values hands-on control over their financial planning.
