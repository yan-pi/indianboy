    "content": "# Vinteum Bitcoin Developer Launchpad - PoC Logbook\n\nalumni: Yan Fernandes\n\nThis logbook documents my journey through the Vinteum Bitcoin Developer Launchpad PoC. It captures my daily progress, challenges faced, solutions implemented, and reflections on the learning process.\n\n## 25-Dec-2025\n\nWell, today **25-Dec-2025** , so it's Christmas! I'm starting my Vinteum Bitcoin Developer Launchpad PoC. My bachelor's thesis was approved. I have taken this time to clear my mind and begin working on my PoC with a fresh perspective.\n\nThis is my PoC:\n\n_\"Implement support in Floresta for tracking incoming silent payments in a watch only wallet as new blocks are processed, inspired by Bitcoin Core’s ongoing design work for silent payments. This PoC focuses only on the “forward scanning” path: given the wallet’s silent payment keys, hook into Floresta’s block processing pipeline, derive and cache the data needed to recognize relevant outputs, and scan each new block to detect matches, updating a lightweight index of received payments. Additionally, the electrum server should be updated with the new silent-payments related endpoints to allow wallet interoperability. The goal is to allow Floresta users to connect their silent payments and find their balances.\"_\n\nOk, I think we can start to break down the task and the deliverables regarding the PoC.\n\n1. **Understanding Silent Payments**: Research and understand the silent payments mechanism in Bitcoin Core. Review the relevant documentation and design proposals to grasp how silent payments work and how they are implemented.\n\n2. **Familiarization with Floresta**: Dive into the Floresta codebase to understand its architecture, especially the block processing pipeline and wallet management components. Identify where modifications will be needed to support silent payments.\n\n3. **Deriving Silent Payment Keys**: Implement functionality to derive silent payment keys from the wallet's existing keys. This will involve understanding the key derivation process and ensuring that the derived keys are stored securely.\n\n4. **Block Processing Integration**: Hook into Floresta's block processing pipeline to enable scanning of new blocks for outputs that match the derived silent payment keys. This will require modifying the block processing logic to include the new scanning functionality.\n\nI've get into the Floresta Discord channel if i need any help regarding the codebase or implementation details.\n\n## 26-Dec-2025\n\nMy research strategy for this PoC will involve a combination of active exploration and guided research with AI tools. I plan to use AI assistants to help me quickly gather information, clarify concepts. Additionally, I will actively explore the [Floresta Codebase](https://github.com/vinteumorg/Floresta), Bitcoin Core documentation and [BIPs Repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/tree/master) to gain a deeper understanding of the systems involved.\n\n1. So, i will use [Grok](https://grok.com/share/c2hhcmQtNA_a97476f0-7f9c-4d78-870c-7cec1f622be0) on search feature to gather information about silent payments in Bitcoin Core, how it works, and what is the current state of its implementation, i only want the links that i should view, and not the actual explanation. I will also look for any existing discussions or proposals related to silent payments to understand the design considerations.\n\n2. Next i will fork and clone the [Floresta Repo](https://github.com/vinteumorg/Floresta) to my local development environment. I will set up the necessary dependencies and build the project to ensure that I can run and test the code.\n\nSearching for Silent Payments and exploring floresta codebase, discord, and documentation, found this resources that will be helpful for my PoC:\n\n### About Silent Payments\n\nResearching BIPs related to Silent Payments and Taproot, I found the following:\n\n#### Approved BIPs Related to Silent Payments and Taproot\n\n- [x] [BIP-341](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0341) - Taproot: SegWit version 1 spending rules. Final and active since 2021; introduces SegWit v1 outputs with Merkle branches for hidden scripts, enhancing privacy and efficiency, though debates persist on quantum resistance without further tweaks.\n\n- [x] [BIP-340](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0340) - Schnorr Signatures for secp256k1. Final and active since 2021; provides 64-byte signatures with linearity for multisig aggregation, widely used in Taproot spends, but some discussions highlight potential for cross-input aggregation in future upgrades.\n\n- [x] [BIP-352](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0352) - Silent Payments: Proposed status as of 2026; enables static addresses for private, non-interactive payments using ECDH tweaks and Taproot outputs, with implementations in wallets like Cake Wallet and Floresta showing real-world adoption for privacy-focused use cases.\n\n**Abstract and Motivation**: _\"BIP-352, authored by josibake and Ruben Somsen, proposes static addresses (e.g., sp1q prefix) for private payments without interaction or on-chain notifications. It addresses address reuse risks by deriving unique Taproot outputs via ECDH shared secrets from sender inputs and receiver keys. Motivation includes eliminating metadata leaks in traditional notifications, supporting labels for differentiation, and compatibility with CoinJoin for enhanced privacy.\"_\n\n**Specification Highlights**:\n\n- **Address Format**:\n  Bech32m-encoded with scan ($B_{\\mathrm{scan}}$) and spend ($B_{\\mathrm{spend}}$) keys;\n\n  labels perform tweak:\n  $$B_m = B_{\\mathrm{spend}} + \\mathrm{hash}(B_{\\mathrm{scan}} \\mid m) \\cdot G$$\n\n- **Sender Process**:\n  Sum input private keys:\n  $$a = \\sum_i a_i$$\n\n  Calculate `input_hash` from the smallest outpoint:\n\n  $$h_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\mathrm{hash}(\\min(\\mathrm{outpoints}))$$\n\n  Derive ECDH secret:\n\n  $$\\mathrm{shared\\_secret} = h_{\\mathrm{in}} \\cdot a \\cdot B_{\\mathrm{scan}}$$\n\n  Tweak for outputs:\n\n  $$t_k = \\mathrm{hash}(\\mathrm{shared\\_secret} \\mid k)$$\n\n  $$P = B_m + t_k \\cdot G$$\n\n- **Receiver Process**:\n  Scan eligible transactions (Taproot outputs and supported inputs),\n  sum public keys:\n  $$A = \\sum_j A_j.$$\n  Compute secrets and match tweaked outputs as:\n  $$P \\stackrel{?}{=} B_m + t_k G.$$\n  Supports light clients via BIP-158 filters or indexes.\n\n- **Security**:\n  Based on ECDLP; separates scan/spend keys; compatible with CoinJoin with caveats\n  (summing inputs from the same entity).\n\n- **Backup/Recovery**:\n  Seed-based, but requires UTXO scan after recovery.\n\nSilent Payments (BIP-352) builds on this for non-interactive privacy, using elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) to derive unique outputs per transaction.\n\n#### Draft and Rejected BIPs Related to Silent Payments and Taproot\n\nFound these BIPs that are in draft or rejected status, but are related to Silent Payments and Taproot, im putting them here just to inform but does not necessary relate directly to my PoC:\n\n- [BIP-114](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0114) - Merkelized Abstract Syntax Tree. Rejected; aimed at Merkle trees for selective script revelation\n- [BIP-117](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0117) - Tail Call Execution Semantics. Draft; proposes subscript execution for generalized MAST\n- [BIP-118](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0118) - SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT for Taproot Scripts. Draft; allows dynamic UTXO binding for off-chain protocols like eltoo\n\n### About Floresta\n\n- [x] [Floresta GitHub Repository](https://github.com/vinteumorg/Floresta) - The main codebase for Floresta, an Electrum Server implementation powered by Utreexo.\n- [x] [Afinal, o que é Schnorr?](https://medium.com/@davidsonlucassouza/afinal-o-que-%C3%A9-schnorr-6ad50bf66097) - by Davidson Souza on Medium\n- [x] [Floresta Update Vinteum medium Post](https://medium.com/vinteum-org/floresta-update-simplifying-bitcoin-node-integration-for-wallets-6886ea7c975c)\n\n  \"If you run a node, you’re the server, so you’re not leaking any information to an untrusted third party. Floresta uses [BIP-158](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0158) compact block filters to search for your wallet’s historical transactions and monitor new blocks. Everything is done locally.\"\n\n- [x] [Introducing Floresta, a Utreexo-powered Electrum Server implementation](https://medium.com/vinteum-org/introducing-floresta-an-utreexo-powered-electrum-server-implementation-60feba8e179d) - by Vinteum on Medium\n\n## 27-Dec-2025\n\nToday i started to explore the Floresta codebase, and Read the floresta-docs repository\n\n- [x] [Floresta Documentation Book](https://github.com/JoseSK999/floresta-docs) - by JoseSK999 on the Floresta Discord server.\n\n- Issue with floresta-docs libraries:\n  - Compilation fails due to dependency error between libraries.\n  - mdbook is at version v0.5.2, but mdbook-quiz only supports version 0.4.45.\n  - Reported the problem on the Floresta Discord.\n  - Considered opening a PR to update mdbook, but the issue is with the dependency cycle.\n  - mdbook-quiz needs to be updated to support newer mdbook versions.\n  - Created an [issue in the mdbook-quiz repo](https://github.com/cognitive-engineering-lab/mdbook-quiz/issues/61).\n  - Opened a [PR in floresta-docs](https://github.com/JoseSK999/floresta-docs/pull/2) to lock mdbook version to 0.4.45, allowing compilation.\n  - willcrichton, mdbook-quiz maintainer, responded positively to the issue. But he does not have time to work into this issue (So, I thought that since im already planing to contribute to Floresta, I can help with this too).\n  - Ive opened a [PR in mdbook-quiz](https://github.com/cognitive-engineering-lab/mdbook-quiz/pull/62/commits/3de0657b76f5cbeca9aaf5ced156adbe5786bc5c) adding support for mdbook v0.5.2. (Ive used AI into this one to only explore and understand the codebase, since i did not have the time to understand certain dependencies and implementations of the codebase)\n  - GitHub has added an experimental feature that sets Copilot to review every PR opened in a repository, so it comments a lot of sloppy suggestions on the PRs I've opened.\n\n## 30-Dec-2025\n\nAnotations about Reading Floresta Book:\n\n1. Binaries:\n\n- florestad - deamon (node) that connects to Bitcoin Core and serves Electrum protocol requests.\n- florestacli - CLI tool to interact with Floresta server.\n\n2. Components:\n\n- floresta-chain\n- floresta-wire\n- floresta common:\n  1. floresta-watch-only (Probably this one is what I will be working the most on)\n  2. floresta-compact-filters\n  3. floresta-electrum\n\n3. Creates:\n\nfloresta -> Export components\nfloresta-rpc -> Powers floresta-cli\nfloresta-node -> Implements node features assembling all the components\n\n## 05-Jan-2026\n\nToday I participated in office hours with Davidson Souza, where he explained more about how Floresta works and the current progress of the project.  \nJoaoLeal asked about how Floresta works with the aggregation feature. Davidson explained how Floresta leaves work, and how Floresta uses Merkle trees to represent UTXOs.\n\n### Merkle Trees and UTXO Representation in Floresta\n\n- **Accumulator Operations:**  \n  Floresta uses accumulator operations in Merkle trees, similar to those in Utreexo. These operations include:\n  - **Addition:** Adding new UTXOs to the tree.\n  - **Insertion:** Placing new nodes at specific positions.\n  - **Deletion:** Removing spent UTXOs from the tree.\n\n- **Key Concepts and Terminology:**\n  - **Index:** The position of a node within the tree.\n  - **Root:** The topmost node representing the entire set of UTXOs.\n  - **Intermediary Node:** Nodes that connect leaves to the root, helping maintain the tree structure.\n  - **Leaf Node:** Represents individual UTXOs.\n  - **Bridge Node:** Connects different parts of the tree, facilitating efficient updates.\n  - **Data:** The actual information stored in each node (e.g., UTXO data).\n  - **Sum:** (If applicable) Used for aggregating values across nodes for quick calculations.\n\n#### Example Operations\n\n- **Addition/Insertion:**  \n  When a new UTXO is created, it is added as a leaf node. The tree is updated, and the root hash changes to reflect the new state.\n\n- **Deletion:**  \n  When a UTXO is spent, its corresponding leaf node is deleted. The tree is rebalanced, and the root hash is updated.\n  \n  (At least this was my understanding of how it works, I will need to dive deeper into the codebase to understand exactly how Floresta implements these operations.)\n\n## 08-Jan-2026\n\nIve already read the floresta docs book and started exploring the codebase\n\n### Codebase Architecture Analysis\n\n#### 1. Watch-Only Wallet Structure\n**Location:** `crates/floresta-watch-only/src/lib.rs`\n\n**Key Components Discovered:**\n\n1. **AddressCache** - Main wallet structure\n   - Wraps `AddressCacheInner` with `Arc<RwLock<>>`\n   - Implements `BlockConsumer` trait (line 558)\n   - Currently returns `wants_spent_utxos() = false`\n\n2. **Database Abstraction** - `AddressCacheDatabase` trait\n   - Two implementations: `KvDatabase` (persistent), `MemoryDatabase` (testing)\n   - Stores: addresses, transactions, stats, UTXOs\n   - Methods: save, load, update, get_cache_height, save_transaction, etc.\n\n3. **Data Structures:**\n   ```rust\n   pub struct CachedAddress {\n       script_hash: Hash,\n       balance: u64,\n       script: ScriptBuf,\n       transactions: Vec<Txid>,\n       utxos: Vec<OutPoint>,\n   }\n   \n   pub struct CachedTransaction {\n       tx: Transaction,\n       height: u32,\n       merkle_block: Option<MerkleProof>,\n       hash: Txid,\n       position: u32,\n   }\n   \n   pub struct Stats {\n       address_count: usize,\n       transaction_count: usize,\n       utxo_count: usize,\n       cache_height: u32,\n       txo_count: usize,\n       balance: u64,\n       derivation_index: u32,\n   }\n   ```\n\n**Critical Insight:** The `Stats` struct will need extension for silent payment data:\n- `sp_output_count`\n- `sp_balance`\n- `sp_label_count`\n\n#### 2. Block Processing Flow\n\n**Current Implementation (lib.rs:182-239):**\n```rust\nfn block_process(&mut self, block: &Block, height: u32) -> Vec<(Transaction, TxOut)> {\n    // 1. Iterate through all transactions\n    // 2. Check inputs for spends (matching our UTXOs)\n    // 3. Check outputs for receives (matching our script_set)\n    // 4. Cache matching transactions\n}\n```\n\n**Pattern:**\n- Uses `HashSet<sha256::Hash>` for script lookups\n- Stores both spends and receives\n- Returns all relevant transaction/output pairs\n\n**SP Integration Point:** I think I can extend this method or create parallel `scan_silent_payments()` method.\n\n#### 3. BlockConsumer Trait\n\n**Location:** `crates/floresta-chain/src/pruned_utreexo/chain_state.rs:66-109`\n\n```rust\npub trait BlockConsumer: Sync + Send + 'static {\n    fn wants_spent_utxos(&self) -> bool;\n    fn on_block(&self, block: &Block, height: u32, \n                spent_utxos: Option<&HashMap<OutPoint, UtxoData>>);\n}\n```\n\n**Key Discovery:** \n- ChainState computes spent UTXOs during validation\n- Passed to consumers via `on_block()` if `wants_spent_utxos() == true`\n\n**Current AddressCache implementation:**\n```rust\nimpl BlockConsumer for AddressCache {\n    fn wants_spent_utxos(&self) -> bool { false }  // Probably Need to change this!\n    fn on_block(&self, block: &Block, height: u32, _spent_utxos: Option<...>) {\n        self.block_process(block, height);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Decision Point:** Might Change `wants_spent_utxos()` to return `true` when SP keys are loaded.\n\n\n### Dependencies Analysis\n\n**Current Crypto Stack (from Cargo.toml):**\n```toml\nbitcoin = \"0.32\"          # Includes secp256k1 v0.29.1\nbitcoin_hashes = \"0.14\"   # SHA256, etc.\nbech32 = \"0.11\"           # For address encoding\nsha2 = \"0.10\"             # Direct SHA2 dependency\n```\n\n**Finding**: All crypto primitives needed for BIP-352 are already available:\n- secp256k1 for ECDH\n- SHA256 for hashing\n- bech32m for address encoding (BIP-350)\n- Point arithmetic for tweaking\n\n**Decision:** We are going to use the existing dependencies, no new crypto libraries needed.\n\n**Trade-off:** Slightly more manual implementation work, but:\n- No version conflicts (less dependency bloat, or dependency hell)\n- No new security audit surface\n- Less supply-chain vulnerabilities risk\n- Better understanding of BIP-352\n- Full control over implementation\n- And this is actually the goal of this PoC! :)\n\n---\n\n### Error Handling Patterns\n\n**Pattern Used in Floresta:**\n- Custom error enums (no `thiserror` except in floresta-electrum)\n- `impl_error_from!` macro for conversions\n- Specific, descriptive error variants\n\n**Example from watch-only:**\n```rust\npub enum WatchOnlyError<DatabaseError: fmt::Debug> {\n    WalletNotInitialized,\n    TransactionNotFound,\n    DatabaseError(DatabaseError),\n}\n```\n\n**Plan:** Create `SilentPaymentError` following this exact pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Testing Infrastructure Discovered\n\n**Code Patterns:**\n\n1. **Inline Tests:** `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`\n2. **Test Data:** Separate `testdata/` directories\n3. **Compression:** Uses `.zst` for large binary test data\n4. **JSON Vectors:** For structured test cases\n5. **Helper Macros:** `assert_ok!`, `assert_err!`, `bhash!`\n\n**Example Pattern:**\n```rust\n#[test]\nfn test_with_vectors() {\n    let data = include_str!(\"../testdata/vectors.json\");\n    let cases: Vec<TestCase> = serde_json::from_str(data).unwrap();\n    for case in cases {\n        // Test each case\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Plan:** I think we can Download BIP-352 related test vectors and use same pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Architecture Decisions\n\n#### Decision 1: Integration vs Separate Crate\n\n**Choice:** Integrate into `floresta-watch-only`\n\n**Rationale:**\n1. Silent payments ARE wallet functionality (receiving funds)\n2. Reuse existing infrastructure:\n   - Database abstraction\n   - Transaction caching\n   - Merkle proof storage\n   - UTXO index\n3. Simpler user experience (one wallet component)\n4. Single rescan operation\n5. Follows Floresta's modular-but-integrated pattern\n\n**Trade-offs:**\n- Couples SP to wallet (acceptable - conceptually related)\n- Less code duplication\n- Shared balance tracking\n- Consistent backup/recovery\n\n#### Decision 2: Dependency Strategy \n\n**Choice:** Use existing `bitcoin` crate primitives\n\n**Rationale:**\n1. All needed crypto already present\n2. No version conflicts\n3. No new security surface\n4. Follows Floresta's \"no custom crypto\" principle\n5. Better BIP-352 understanding through manual implementation\n\n**Alternative Considered:** `rust-silentpayments` crate\n- Reference implementation available\n- Additional dependency\n- Potential version conflicts with secp256k1\n- **Decision:** Use as reference, don't depend on it\n\n#### Decision 3: BlockConsumer Strategy\n**Choice:** Modify AddressCache to request spent UTXOs conditionally\n\n**Implementation Plan:**\n```rust\nimpl BlockConsumer for AddressCache {\n    fn wants_spent_utxos(&self) -> bool {\n        // Return true if SP keys are loaded\n        self.has_silent_payment_keys()\n    }\n    \n    fn on_block(&self, block: &Block, height: u32, \n                spent_utxos: Option<&HashMap<OutPoint, UtxoData>>) {\n        // Call regular scanning\n        self.block_process(block, height);\n        \n        // If SP enabled and spent_utxos provided\n        if let Some(utxos) = spent_utxos {\n            self.scan_silent_payments(block, height, utxos);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Rationale:**\n- ChainState already computes spent UTXOs\n- Free performance (no extra lookups needed)\n- Clean integration point\n- Backward compatible (only active when SP keys present)\n\n---\n\n### Project Structure Plan\n\n**New Files to Create:**\n\nThis is what im thinking to build the silent payments module inside floresta-watch-only:\n\n```\ncrates/floresta-watch-only/\n├── src/\n│   ├── silent_payments/       # New module\n│   │   ├── mod.rs             # Public API & integration\n│   │   ├── bip352.rs          # Core BIP-352 spec implementation\n│   │   ├── scanner.rs         # Block scanning logic\n│   │   ├── keys.rs            # Key derivation & management\n│   │   ├── labels.rs          # Label computation & caching\n│   │   ├── database.rs        # Database extensions\n│   │   └── error.rs           # SP-specific errors\n│   └── lib.rs                 # (modify - add module)\n├── testdata/\n│   └── bip352/\n│       ├── send_and_receive_test_vectors.json\n│       └── README.md          # Attribution\n```\n\n**Modified Files:**\n```\ncrates/floresta-watch-only/Cargo.toml  # Add feature flag\ncrates/floresta-watch-only/src/lib.rs  # Import SP module\ncrates/floresta-watch-only/src/kv_database.rs  # Extend for SP\n```\n\n\n### Next Day Gloals:\n\n1. **Run Floresta on Signet** \n   - Start node with debug logging\n   - Observe IBD process\n   - Monitor resource usage\n   - Document block processing flow\n\n2. **Explore Live Behavior**\n   - Watch logs in real-time\n   - Test RPC commands\n   - Examine created database files\n   - Understand data directory structure\n\n3. **Test Watch-Only Wallet**\n   - Load a test descriptor\n   - Trigger rescan\n   - Observe transaction detection\n   - Document wallet behavior\n\n4. **Analyze Block Structure**\n   - Get blocks with taproot outputs\n   - Examine witness data\n   - Identify SP-eligible transactions\n   - Document input type distribution\n\n### Technical Insights Gained Today\n\n1. **BlockConsumer might be the Perfect Hook**\n   - Clean abstraction for receiving blocks\n   - Spent UTXOs available on request\n   - ZMQ server uses same pattern (reference)\n\n2. **Floresta internal Database is Easily Extensible**\n   - Trait-based design\n   - KV store buckets\n   - Can add SP-specific buckets: `sp_keys`, `sp_labels`, `sp_outputs`\n\n3. **Transaction Caching is Robust**\n   - Already handles merkle proofs\n   - Stores tx height and position\n   - Can reuse for SP outputs\n\n4. **No Dependency Blockers**\n   - All crypto available\n   - No conflicts\n   - Clean foundation\n\n### Environment Setup\n\n**System Information:**\n- **Rust Version:** 1.89.0 (MSRV: 1.81.0)\n- **Cargo Version:** 1.89.0\n- **Platform:** macOS (aarch64)\n- **Build Status:** Success in 43.11s\n- **Tests:** 9/9 passing in floresta-watch-only\n\n**Key Finding:** Floresta builds cleanly with no warnings, errors or needing any type of workarounds.\n\n\n## 11-Dec-2026\n\nThe beginning of the year is always complicated for me—it's a time to wrap up last year's pending tasks and kick off the new year (not to mention participating in festive dates).

I won't give you a recipe — I'll tell you what actually works: visibility, accountability, and the ability to generate value.\n\n## The Short Truth About Working for Free (It Was the Best Decision of My Life)\n\nI worked for free for the company I'm now a partner in.\nIt wasn't charity — it was an investment.\nNot everything is measured in dollars.\n\nSometimes what you gain is much more valuable:\n\n- purpose (doing something that matters),\n- mentorship (people to pull you forward),\n- access (clients, investors, partners).\n\nIf you're going to give up salary, make it for something that truly pays off in the medium term: equity, direct product experience, networks you couldn't access otherwise.\nWithout that, it's exploitation.\n\n## Build in Public: Why and How Without Nonsense\n\nTalking about what you do doesn't help. Showing does. Building in public means exposing the process — mistakes, decisions, and metrics — and it works for three reasons:\n\n- Attracts people who truly help (contributors, clients, partners).\n- Creates permanent reputation: your work becomes your resume.\n- Accelerates learning: fast real feedback.\n\nHow to start now:\n\n- publish a public repo with an honest README;\n- make commits explaining decisions;\n- post short updates: what worked, what broke, what you'll change.\n\n> Talk is cheap. Show me the code.\n> ~ Linus Torvalds\n\n## Agency = Self-Management. Be Your Own Company Before Having One\n\n\"Having agency\" isn't opening a business just for status — it's acting like an owner: defining scope, delivering on time, charging for value. This makes you scalable:\n\n- Learn to negotiate scope and prioritize value over perfection.\n- Make clear proposals, measure results, and communicate risks.\n- Within companies: act like a mini-producer — whoever delivers, leads.\n\nWhen your mindset becomes \"agency,\" you can work as an employee, consultant, or start a business with less trauma.\n\n## Entrepreneurship Without Myths: Real and Pragmatic Options\n\nYou don't need to become a unicorn. Real possibilities:\n\n- Niche consulting (you solve problem X for clients Y).\n- Simple product/SaaS with 5 paying clients before scaling.\n- Open source + services (support, customization).\n\nTaleb's rule applied: combine security with small bets with high upside. Don't put all your eggs in one basket.\n\n## Working for Free with Criteria — Basic Rules\n\nIf you're going to work without getting paid, be strategic:\n\n- clear objective (mentorship, equity, validation),\n- time limit (3 months, 6 months, project X, delivery Y),\n- return metric (introduction to X, first client, MVP, networking).\n\nIf you don't have these three, ask for payment.\nYour time is a scarce asset — protect the downside.\n\n## College: Use It for Networking, Don't Expect the Content to Employ You\n\nCollege is still worth it — but not for the curriculum.\nIt's worth it for colleagues, multidisciplinary projects, and access to people.\nDo projects with business, design, and sales people. Don't become hostage to professors. Learn on your own: real projects, internships, and open source.\n\n## Open Source as a Career (Yes, You Can Make a Living From It)\n\nContributing publicly is the fastest path to technical reputation. Linus showed that contributing solves two problems: visibility and real maintenance experience. Strategy:\n\n- start by solving small issues;\n- write good documentation;\n- choose an area and become a reference.\n\nOpen source can become a job, consulting, and product. Just don't think it's just posting and waiting; you'll usually have to maintain the work.\n\n## TL;DR:\n\n- antifragility: protect the downside, make many small bets.\n- build and maintain: be ready for the dirty work; focus on the user.\n- seek leverage (product, content, code that scales) and do what gives you pleasure.\n- think product and market; don't deliver technology without a value model.\n- community and practice: quality comes from code that's used, not theory.\n\nact, publish, maintain, monetize (when it makes sense).\n\n## Practical Checklist — Do This in the Next 4 Weeks\n\n- Week 1 — Create a public repo with a README describing the real problem you solve.\n- Week 2 — Make 1 PR to an open source project you use (documentation or simple bug).\n- Week 3 — Post 2 \"build in public\" updates (decision you made; mistake you fixed).\n- Week 4 — Schedule 5 contacts from college/work for 20 min each — ask about real problems.\n\nDo this every month.\n\n> \"Consistency beats talent that disappears.\"\n> ~ Naval Ravikant\n\n## Conclusion: Stop Waiting for Permission\n\nCollege helps, mentorship helps, working for free sometimes helps — but nothing replaces showing work. (proof of work)\n\nIf you want to get into tech, turn yourself into a one-person agency: deliver, publish, maintain, and monetize when you can.\nBe antifragile: protect yourself, risk small bets, and collect opportunities.\nStop waiting for permission. Start now."

[Overview](#overview)\n2. [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)\n3. [Step 1: Load HID modules](#step-1-load-hid-modules)\n4. [Step 2: Configure `/etc/bluetooth/main.conf`](#step-2-configure-etcbluetoothmainconf)\n5. [Step 3: Enable `bluetoothd --experimental`](#step-3-enable-bluetoothd---experimental)\n6. [Step 4: Pair in BLE mode (HOGP)](#step-4-pair-in-ble-mode-hogp)\n7. [Step 5: Make persistent](#step-5-make-persistent)\n8. [Reversal (optional)](#reversal-optional)\n\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nMany modern keyboards, like the Keychron K3, use the BLE HID over GATT (HOGP) profile. On Arch Linux, you need to:\n\n- Ensure the kernel modules (`uhid`, `hidp`) are loaded\n- Configure BlueZ for `ControllerMode = dual` and `--experimental` in the daemon\n- Pair in the BLE slot (Fn+2 or Fn+3) with a NoInputNoOutput agent (Just Works)\n- Persist module loading and automatic reconnection via systemd\n\n---\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Functional Bluetooth adapter and `btusb` driver\n- `bluez` and `bluez-utils` installed:\n\n  ```bash\n  sudo pacman -S bluez bluez-utils\n  ```\n\n- Bluetooth service enabled and running:\n\n  ```bash\n  sudo systemctl enable --now bluetooth\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Load HID modules\n\n1. Load manually:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo modprobe uhid hidp\n   ```\n   \n2. To persist at boot, create `/etc/modules-load.d/bluetooth-hid.conf`:\n\n   ```bash\n   echo -e \"uhid hidp\" | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/bluetooth-hid.conf\n   ```\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Configure `/etc/bluetooth/main.conf`\n\nEdit with your favorite editor (`nano`, `vim`, etc.):\n\n```ini\n[General]\nControllerMode = dual   # EDR + BLE\nAutoEnable = true       # Automatically power adapter\n```\n\nRestart the service:\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl restart bluetooth\n```\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Enable `bluetoothd --experimental`\n\n1. Create the drop-in:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/bluetooth.service.d\n   sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/bluetooth.service.d/override.conf <<EOF\n   [Service]\n   ExecStart=\n   ExecStart=/usr/lib/bluetooth/bluetoothd --experimental\n   EOF\n   ```\n  \n2. Reload and restart:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo systemctl daemon-reload\n   sudo systemctl restart bluetooth\n   ```\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Pair in BLE mode (HOGP)\n\n1. On the keyboard, press **Fn + 2** (slot 2) until the LED blinks.\n2. In the terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo bluetoothctl\n   [bluetooth]# agent NoInputNoOutput\n   [bluetooth]# default-agent\n   [bluetooth]# scan on\n   # Wait for DC:2C:26:37:2E:F5 (LE)\n   [bluetooth]# pair DC:2C:26:37:2E:F5\n   [bluetooth]# trust DC:2C:26:37:2E:F5\n   [bluetooth]# connect DC:2C:26:37:2E:F5\n   ```\n   \n3. Check in `info` if `00001812-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb (HID over GATT)` appears.\n4. Test typing in a text editor.\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Make persistent\n\n1. **Mark as trusted** (already done in pairing above).\n2. **Ensure modules** (already persisted in `/etc/modules-load.d`).\n3. **systemd service for reconnection**:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/connect-keychron.service > /dev/null <<EOF\n   [Unit]\n   Description=Reconnect Keychron K3 BLE\n   After=bluetooth.target\n   Wants=bluetooth.target\n\n   [Service]\n   Type=oneshot\n   ExecStart=/usr/bin/bluetoothctl connect DC:2C:26:37:2E:F5\n\n   [Install]\n   WantedBy=multi-user.target\n   EOF\n   ```\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo systemctl enable connect-keychron.service\n   sudo systemctl start connect-keychron.service\n   ```\n\nOn the next reboot, the keyboard will reconnect automatically (if kept in the active BLE slot).\n\n---\n\n## Reversal (optional)\n\nTo undo everything:\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl disable connect-keychron.service\nsudo rm /etc/systemd/system/connect-keychron.service\nsudo rm /etc/modules-load.d/bluetooth-hid.conf\nsudo rm -r /etc/systemd/system/bluetooth.service.d\nsudo systemctl daemon-reload\nsudo systemctl restart bluetooth\n```"

    "content": "Over the past months, I have adopted a practical and developer-friendly approach to personal finance management by leveraging my daily tools: Neovim, GitHub Copilot, and a system of monthly ledger books in Markdown.\n\n#### Why This Stack?\n\n- **Neovim**: As my primary editor, Neovim offers speed, extensibility, and a distraction-free environment. It allows me to quickly create, edit, and navigate my financial notes and ledgers.\n- **GitHub Copilot**: Copilot acts as an AI assistant, helping automate calculations, generate summaries, and even suggest improvements to my financial tracking workflow.\n- **Monthly Ledger Books**: By maintaining a separate Markdown file for each month, I can clearly track all transactions, recurring expenses, and financial goals. This structure makes it easy to review progress and adjust plans as needed.\n\n#### Folder Organization\n\nMy setup uses a simple, logical folder structure:\n\n```\n30-RESOURCES/\n  3002-LEDGER/\n    300201-INDEX.md        # Ledger system overview and methodology\n    300202-06-2025.md      # June 2025 ledger\n    300202-07-2025.md      # July 2025 ledger\n    300202-08-2025.md      # August 2025 ledger\n```\n\nEach monthly file contains:\n\n- A summary of objectives and reserve goals\n- A Markdown table logging all transactions (date, description, amount, running balance)\n- Calculations for value gaps and recovery plans\n- Monthly spending and savings targets\n- Notes on recurring expenses and installment purchases\n\n#### Example: Monthly Ledger Entry\n\n```markdown\n| Date       | Description            | Amount  | Balance |\n| ---------- | ---------------------- | ------- | ------- |\n| 2025-08-01 | Opening Balance        | 0.00    | 0.00    |\n| 2025-08-01 | Parcel Purchase (1/10) | -454.40 | -454.40 |\n| 2025-08-01 | Disney+                | -50.00  | -504.40 |\n| 2025-08-01 | Gamepass               | -70.00  | -574.40 |\n```\n\n#### How It Works\n\n1. **Monthly Ledger Files**: Each month gets its own Markdown file, where I log every transaction, categorize expenses, and calculate running balances.\n2. **Financial Planning**: At the start of each month, I set spending and savings targets, and list all known fixed and variable expenses.\n3. **Continuous Review**: I update the ledger daily or weekly, using Copilot to help with calculations and summaries.\n4. **Retrospective**: At the end of the month, I review my progress, analyze spending patterns, and plan for the next month.\n\n#### Benefits Experienced\n\n- **Increased Awareness**: Logging every transaction makes me more conscious of my spending habits.\n- **Better Planning**: Setting explicit monthly goals helps me prioritize savings and control unnecessary expenses.\n- **Immediate Feedback**: With just two months of consistent tracking, I already notice improved discipline and financial clarity.\n- **Developer Workflow**: Using tools I already love (Neovim, Markdown, Git), the process feels natural and integrated into my daily routine.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nCombining Neovim, Copilot, and monthly ledger books has transformed my approach to personal finance. This workflow is simple, transparent, and highly customizable—perfect for anyone who prefers text-based tools and values hands-on control over their financial planning."

    "content": "> **TL;DR:** Split keyboards let you type at shoulder width, reducing wrist strain. Start with an open source design like Corne or Lily58, go low-profile (Choc) if you want portability, and invest time in learning layers — they're essential for small boards.\n\n## The Problem\n\nI used to think wrist pain was just part of being a developer. Eight hours of coding, sore wrists, tense shoulders. Normal, right?\n\nThen I get into [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2bJkzIaPE) from Ben Valek, were he goes into the topic of ergonomics and split keyboards, and i started thinking about it, i was already using keyboard first tools (like neovim, cli and tui to do major of my job).\n\nThen I watched myself type. My wrists were bent inward, shoulders hunched forward, fingers reaching awkwardly for keys that were never designed for human hands, some keys I pressed sometimes with one hand, sometimes with the other. The standard keyboard layout dates back to typewriters. We're still using it in 2025.\n\nSomething had to change.\n\n## Why Split Keyboards\n\nHere's the thing about regular keyboards: they force your hands together. Your shoulders roll forward. Your wrists angle inward. Do that for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, and your body will let you know.\n\nSplit keyboards fix this by letting you place each half at shoulder width. Your arms stay parallel. Your wrists stay straight. It sounds simple because it is.\n\nBut there's more to it. Most split keyboards also use **column stagger** instead of row stagger. On a regular keyboard, each row is offset horizontally — a leftover from typewriter mechanics. Column stagger aligns keys vertically based on finger length. Your fingers move up and down naturally instead of reaching diagonally.\n\n## Choosing Your Path: Build vs Buy\n\nThis is where it gets interesting. You have three options:\n\n### Open Source Designs\n\nThe community has created dozens of tested, refined keyboard designs. The most popular:\n\n- **Corne (Crkbd)** — 42 keys, minimal, the one I use daily. Forces you to learn layers.\n- **Lily58** — 58 keys, more forgiving. I built one of these first.\n- **Sofle** — Similar to Lily58 with rotary encoder support.\n\nThese are open source. The PCB files, firmware, and build guides are all free. You can order PCBs from JLCPCB or PCBWay for cheap. The catch? You need to source parts and solder.\n\nyou can search with this resources: \n- [jhelvy](https://jhelvy.github.io/splitKbCompare/)\n- [r/ErgoMechKeyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/)\n\n### Commercial Options\n\nIf soldering isn't your thing, companies like **ZSA** make production-quality split keyboards:\n\n- **Moonlander** — Full-featured, lots of keys, RGB, tenting built in\n- **Voyager** — Their newer, more minimal option\n\nTyperactive sells pre-built Corne and Lily58 keyboards as well.\n\n- [typeractive](https://www.typeractive.com/)\n\nYou pay more, but you get a finished product with support and a nice configurator.\n\n### The KiCad Path\n\nIf you really want to go deep, you can design your own. KiCad is free and open source. The community has tutorials for keyboard PCB design. I wouldn't recommend this as your first split, but it's there when you're ready to create something truly custom.\n\nYou can check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WXpGTIbxlQ) from Joe Scotto and the [Absolem Discord channel](https://discord.gg/v6rMHrAqKw).\n\n![Ergogen keyboard design tool](/ergogen.jpg)\n\n![PCB design in KiCad](/kicad.webp)\n\n**My take:** Start with an open source design. Buy a kit if you don't want to source parts yourself. Move to commercial if you value your time over money. Design your own when you've used enough keyboards to know exactly what you want.\n\n## The Anatomy of a Split Keyboard\n\nBefore you buy or build, understand what you're choosing:\n\n### High Profile vs Low Profile\n\nThis refers to the switches and keycaps:\n\n- **MX-style (high profile)** — The standard. Taller switches, more key travel, louder. Huge variety of switches and keycaps available.\n- **Choc (low profile)** — Kailh's low-profile switches. Shorter travel, quieter, more portable. Fewer keycap options, but the keyboard sits much lower on your desk.\n\nI use Choc switches on my Corne. The low profile means I don't need a wrist rest — my hands just hover naturally. If you're coming from a laptop keyboard, low profile feels familiar.\n\n### Thumb Clusters\n\nThis is the superpower of split keyboards. Instead of your thumbs doing nothing (or just hitting spacebar), they get their own cluster of keys.\n\nOn a Corne, each thumb has 3 keys. That's 6 extra keys in the most accessible position on the entire board. I use mine for:\n\n- Space and Enter (the obvious ones)\n- Layer switches\n- Backspace\n- Modifiers\n\nSuddenly you're not stretching your pinky for Ctrl or reaching for Backspace. Your strongest, most dexterous fingers handle it.\n\n### Column Stagger\n\nLook at your fingers. They're different lengths. Column stagger accounts for this — the columns are offset vertically so each finger moves straight up and down. It feels weird for about a week. Then regular keyboards feel wrong.\n\n## The Software Side\n\nHardware is half the story. The real magic happens in firmware.\n\n### QMK vs ZMK\n\nTwo main options:\n\n- **QMK** — The standard. Runs on wired keyboards. Incredibly powerful, great documentation, huge community.\n- **ZMK** — Built for wireless. If you want Bluetooth, this is your choice. Slightly less mature but actively developed.\n\n> Each firmware needs to be compatible with your keyboard's PCB and microcontroller. Check before you start.\n\nI use ZMK because I wanted wireless. No regrets.\n> Both are solid choices. but QMK has been around longer and has more resources.\n\n### Layers: Essential for Small Boards\n\nOn a 42-key Corne, you don't have dedicated number keys, function keys, or a navigation cluster. They're all on layers.\n\nThink of layers like Shift for your entire keyboard. Hold a key, and suddenly you're on a different layout. Release, and you're back.\n\nMy setup:\n\n- **Base** — Letters, basic punctuation\n- **Lower** — Numbers, arrows and Function keys\n- **Raise** — Symbols, and math operators\n\n![Base layer - Letters and basic punctuation](/Screenshot%202026-01-23%20at%2018.00.29.png)\n\n![Lower layer - Numbers, arrows and Function keys](/Screenshot%202026-01-23%20at%2018.00.42.png)\n\n![Raise layer - Symbols and math operators](/Screenshot%202026-01-23%20at%2018.00.52.png)\n\nIt takes about two weeks to build muscle memory. After that, you'll wonder why you ever wanted 104 keys.\n\n### Homerow Mods: The Next Level\n\nI haven't fully committed to these yet, but the concept is clever. Your home row keys (A, S, D, F, J, K, L, ;) become dual-function:\n\n- Tap for the letter\n- Hold for a modifier (Ctrl, Alt, Shift, Super)\n\nSo holding 'F' gives you Ctrl. Holding 'J' gives you Ctrl on the other hand. No more pinky stretching.\n\nThe challenge is timing. Set the hold threshold wrong and you'll get accidental modifiers while typing fast. The community has spent years tuning this. If you want to try, start with someone else's tested config.\n\n## Finding Your Resting Position\n\nYou have the keyboard. Now where do you put it?\n\n### Tenting and Tilting\n\nTenting angles the inner edge of each half upward. Instead of your palms facing down, they face slightly inward — like you're about to clap. This is the natural resting position for your hands.\n\nTenting depends of the case that you are using, you have a lot of setups that you can use for tenting.\nEven 10-15 degrees makes a difference.\n\nTilting is the front-to-back angle. Contrary to what keyboard feet suggest, you probably want **negative tilt** — the back lower than the front. This keeps your wrists straighter.\n\n### Wrist Rests: Maybe Not\n\nHot take: with a low-profile split keyboard and proper positioning, you might not need wrist rests. Your hands should hover, with your forearms doing the support work.\n\nIf you do use them, rest your palms, not your wrists. And don't rest while actively typing — only during pauses.\n\n### Keyboard Placement\n\nPut each half directly in front of its corresponding shoulder. Yes, this feels absurdly wide at first. Your mouse goes between them or to the side, depending on how often you use it.\n\n## A Quick Note on Standing Desks\n\nStanding complements split keyboards well. When you stand, you're more likely to keep your shoulders back and arms at the right angle.\n\nThe key is alternating. Stand for a while, sit for a while. Neither position is meant to be held for 8 hours.\n\n## My Setup\n\nFor reference, here's what I actually use:\n\n- **Keyboard:** Corne with Kailh Choc switches (low profile, linear)\n- **Previous:** Custom-built Lily58 with Choc — great for learning, but I wanted fewer keys\n- **Firmware:** ZMK for wireless\n- **Keycaps:** MBK profile (low profile, sculpted)\n- **Tenting:** Since my splitkb is low profile, I dont use tenting (might add magsafe stands later)\n\nThe journey from Lily58 to Corne taught me that fewer keys isn't a limitation — it's a feature. Every key is within easy reach. Nothing is wasted.\n\n## What I Learned\n\nAfter going through multiple builds and configurations:\n\n1. **Start with more keys, not fewer.** Lily58 or Sofle for your first build. Go minimal later when you understand layers.\n\n2. **Low profile is underrated.** Less fatigue, more portable, works great without a wrist rest.\n\n3. **Layers take two weeks.** The learning curve is real but finite. Push through.\n\n4. **Thumb clusters are the real upgrade.** More than split, more than column stagger. Your thumbs are wasted on regular keyboards.\n\n5. **Open source first.** You'll learn more building than buying. And when something breaks, you can fix it.\n\n6. **Your body will tell you.** Pain means something's wrong. Adjust position, adjust timing, adjust the keyboard itself. Don't ignore it.\n\nThe hardest part is the first two weeks. Your brain knows where keys should be, and they're not there anymore. Stick with it. The payoff is typing all day without pain.\n\nThat's worth some temporary frustration."

    "content": "## Introduction\n\nThis documentation describes how to create a **single authentication microservice** that enables access to various services, where each service has its own roles and permissions system with variable granularity. The goal is to allow a user to have different roles and permissions in distinct services, with this information transmitted via **JWT** to manage access control using **RBAC** (Role-Based Access Control) and **ABAC** (Attribute-Based Access Control).\n\n## Problem\n\nThe scenario involves:\n- **Multiple services** (e.g., Blog, eCommerce, etc.), each with its own access control rules.\n- **Shared users across services**, with distinct roles and permissions in each service.\n- **Autonomy of each service** to define roles and permissions with varying levels of granularity.\n- **Centralized authentication** but distributed authorization, with each service validating and controlling access independently.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe proposed solution includes:\n1. **A centralized authentication microservice** that generates JWT tokens containing a user’s roles and permissions across different services.\n2. **Each service is responsible for its own access control rules**, validating the JWT and making authorization decisions based on the roles and permissions within the token.\n3. **An efficiently structured relational database** to store relationships between users, services, roles, and permissions.\n\n---\n\n## Database Structure\n\n### Main Entities\n\n- **User (`User`)**: Represents the system user.\n- **Service (`Service`)**: Represents each service or application a user can access.\n- **Role (`Role`)**: Defines the roles associated with a specific service for a user.\n- **Permission (`Permission`)**: Specifies permissions that can be assigned to each role.\n- **User Role Assignment (`UserRole`)**: Links a user to a specific service and defines their role within that service.\n- **Role Permission Assignment (`RolePermission`)**: Maps permissions to roles within each service.\n\n### ER Diagram\n\nThe diagram below, created with **Mermaid**, shows the relationships between the main database entities:\n\n<Mermaid chart={`\nerDiagram\n    User {\n        int id PK\n        string email\n        string password_hash\n        string name\n    }\n\n    Service {\n        int id PK\n        string name\n        string description\n    }\n\n    Role {\n        int id PK\n        string name\n        string description\n        int service_id FK\n    }\n\n    Permission {\n        int id PK\n        string name\n        string description\n        int service_id FK\n    }\n\n    UserRole {\n        int id PK\n        int user_id FK\n        int role_id FK\n        int service_id FK\n    }\n\n    RolePermission {\n        int id PK\n        int role_id FK\n        int permission_id FK\n        int service_id FK\n    }\n\n    User ||--o{ UserRole : \"assigned\"\n    Service ||--o{ UserRole : \"uses\"\n    Service ||--o{ Role : \"defines roles\"\n    Service ||--o{ Permission : \"defines permissions\"\n    Role ||--o{ RolePermission : \"has\"\n    Permission ||--o{ RolePermission : \"assigned to\"\n`} />\n\n---\n\n## Model Explanation\n\n### 1. **User (`User`)**\n\nThe `User` table contains user information such as `id`, `email`, `password_hash`, and `name`. Users can access multiple services and have different roles in each one.\n\n### 2. **Service (`Service`)**\n\nThe `Service` table stores information about each service or application. Each service can have its own roles and permissions.\n\n### 3. **Role (`Role`)**\n\nThe `Role` table defines roles (like `Admin`, `User`, etc.) within a service. Each service can have specific roles, independent of other services.\n\n### 4. **Permission (`Permission`)**\n\nThe `Permission` table defines specific permissions for each service, which can vary in granularity depending on the service.\n\n### 5. **User Role Assignment (`UserRole`)**\n\nThis table connects users to roles in a specific service. A user can have different roles in different services.\n\n### 6. **Role Permission Assignment (`RolePermission`)**\n\nThis table maps permissions to each role within a service, allowing a `Role` to have specific permissions for its service.\n\n---\n\n## Authentication and Authorization Flow\n\n### 1. **Authentication**\n\n- The user authenticates with the authentication microservice.\n- A **JWT** is generated with user claims, including their `roles` and permissions for the accessible services.\n- JWT payload example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sub\": \"1\",\n  \"roles\": [\n    {\"service\": \"Blog\", \"role\": \"Admin\"},\n    {\"service\": \"eCommerce\", \"role\": \"User\"}\n  ],\n  \"permissions\": [\n    {\"service\": \"Blog\", \"permissions\": [\"write\", \"read\"]},\n    {\"service\": \"eCommerce\", \"permissions\": [\"purchase\"]}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### 2. **Authorization**\n\n- Each service validates the JWT and extracts user role and permission information.\n- Based on the user’s roles, the system checks if they have permission to perform specific actions in the service (**RBAC**).\n- If the service uses ABAC, it may check additional attributes of the user or context for more granular authorization.\n\n---\n\n## Example of Different Granularity Between Services\n\n### **Blog Service**\n\n- **Roles**: `Admin`, `Editor`, `Viewer`\n- **Permissions**: `write`, `read`\n- The `Admin` role can have `write` and `read` permissions, while the `Viewer` role may only have `read` permission.\n\n### **eCommerce Service**\n\n- **Roles**: `Admin`, `Customer`, `Vendor`\n- **Permissions**: `manage orders`, `purchase`, `manage products`\n- The `Vendor` role may have permissions like `manage products`, while `Customer` may have the `purchase` permission.\n\n---\n\n## Relationship Table Organization\n\n### `UserRole` Table\n\nThis table stores the relationship between users, roles, and services. Example:\n\n| id  | user_id | role_id | service_id |                                 |\n| --- | ------- | ------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- |\n| 1   | 1       | 1       | 1          | (Alice is Admin in Blog)        |\n| 2   | 1       | 5       | 2          | (Alice is Customer in eCommerce)|\n| 3   | 2       | 2       | 1          | (Bob is Editor in Blog)         |\n| 4   | 3       | 3       | 1          | (Carol is Viewer in Blog)       |\n| 5   | 3       | 4       | 2          | (Carol is Admin in eCommerce)   |\n\n### `RolePermission` Table\n\nThis table maps permissions to each role in each service. Example:\n\n| id  | role_id | permission_id | service_id |                                         |\n| --- | ------- | ------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------- |\n| 1   | 1       | 1             | 1          | (Admin in Blog can Write)               |\n| 2   | 1       | 2             | 1          | (Admin in Blog can Read)                |\n| 3   | 2       | 1             | 1          | (Editor in Blog can Write)              |\n| 4   | 2       | 2             | 1          | (Editor in Blog can Read)               |\n| 5   | 3       | 2             | 1          | (Viewer in Blog can Read)               |\n| 6   | 4       | 3             | 2          | (Admin in eCommerce can Manage Orders)  |\n| 7   | 5       | 4             | 2          | (Customer in eCommerce can Purchase)    |\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis database model and authentication/authorization flow provide:\n- **Flexibility**: Allows each service to have independent roles and permissions, adapting to each one’s specific needs.\n- **Scalability**: The system remains efficient and organized, even with a growing number of users and services.\n- **Centralized authentication**: Facilitates user management across multiple services, ensuring a single point of control for authentication.\n\nThis system guarantees robust and flexible access control for complex scenarios involving multiple services and varying permission granularity."

    "content": "## Introduction\n\nThis document should serve as a basis for semantic versioning and releases used in FESF projects. However, it is important to note that semantic versioning is a practice that can be used in any project, regardless of size or complexity.\n\n## What is Semantic Versioning?\n\n> Semantic Versioning is a set of rules for keeping track of versions in code development. It is a general model that all users can understand and use.\n\n## Semantic Versioning Rules\n\n### Version Number Format\n\nThe version number **MUST** follow the format `vX.Y.Z`, where:\n- **X** = major version\n- **Y** = minor version\n- **Z** = patch version\n\nEach part **MUST** increase numerically, with no leading zeros.\n\n### Types of Versions\n\n- **Patch Version (Z):** Incremented for backwards-compatible bug fixes.\n- **Minor Version (Y):** Incremented for new backwards-compatible features or deprecation of features.\n- **Major Version (X):** Incremented for changes that are not backwards-compatible.\n\n### Pre-release Versions\n\nMay be indicated with a hyphen after the patch version, and have lower precedence than the normal version. **Examples:** `v1.0.0-alpha`, `v1.0.0-alpha.1`.\n\n### Build Metadata\n\nMay be added after the version, preceded by a plus sign. Does not affect precedence. **Example:** `v1.0.0-alpha+001`.\n\n### Version Precedence\n\nPrecedence **MUST** be calculated by comparing the version identifiers numerically (major, minor, patch, and pre-release). Pre-release versions have lower precedence than normal versions.\n\n**Examples:**\n- `v1.0.0 < 2.0.0`\n- `v1.0.0-alpha < 1.0.0`\n\n## Creating a New Release on GitHub\n\n### 1. Navigate to the Repository\n- On GitHub, go to the repository's `main page`.\n- To the right of the file list, click on `Releases`.\n\n### 2. Start a New Release\n- At the top of the page, click on `Draft a new release`.\n\n### 3. Choose a Tag for the Release\n- Click the `Choose a tag` dropdown:\n  - To use an `existing tag`, click the desired tag.\n  - To create a `new tag`, enter a version number for the release and click\n `Create new tag`.\n- If you created a new tag, select the `Target` menu and click the branch that contains the project you want to release.\n\n### 4. Set the Previous Tag (Optional)\n- Above the description field, select the `Previous tag` dropdown and click the tag that identifies the previous release.\n\n### 5. Fill in the Release Title\n- In the `Release title` field, enter a title for your release.\n\n### 6. Generate Release Notes\n- Above the description field, click on `Generate release notes`.\n- Check the generated notes to ensure they include all (and only) the desired information.\n\n### 7. Include Binary Files (Optional)\n- To include binary files, such as compiled programs, drag and drop or manually select the files in the `binaries` box.\n\n### 8. If it is a Beta/Alpha version, mark as Pre-Release.\n- To notify users that the release is not ready for production and may be unstable, select `This is a pre-release`.\n\n### 9. Set as Latest Release (Optional)\n- Select `Set as latest release`. If not selected, the label will be assigned automatically based on semantic versioning.\n\n### 11. Publish or Save Release Draft\n- To publish your release, click on `Publish release`.\n- To work on the release later, click on `Save draft`.\n\n> **Note:** After saving or publishing, you can view your releases in the repository's release feed.\n\n## Bookmarks\n\n[Semantic Release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/)\n\n[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)"

    "content": "## What is Vue.js?\n\nVue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It is designed to be flexible and adopted incrementally, which means you can use only what you need. Vue can be integrated into existing projects or used to create complete applications, such as SPAs (Single Page Applications).\n\n## Historical Context\n\n<hr />\n\n**Created by:** Evan You — also the creator of [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)\n\n**Released in:** February 2014\n\n**Context:** Evan You was working at Google using AngularJS on various projects. He felt the need to create something lighter and more flexible, taking the parts he liked most from Angular and simplifying what he considered complex or heavy.\n\n## What Makes Vue.js Different?\n\n<hr />\n\n1. **Gentle learning curve:** Vue is easy to learn, especially for those already familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n\n2. **Flexibility and scalability:** You can use Vue for small or large projects, adjusting its architecture as needed.\n\n3. **Optimized performance:** Vue is fast and efficient, with a reactive architecture that ensures automatic updates to the interface when data changes.\n\n4. **Rich ecosystem, but not overwhelming:** The Vue ecosystem is powerful and includes tools like Vue Router, Vuex, and the Vue CLI, but you can choose to use them as needed.\n\n5. **Excellent documentation:** Vue's documentation is clear and comprehensive, making it easy to learn and implement new features.\n\n![Pasted image 20240815200949.png]\n\n## Vue APIs: Options API vs. Composition API\n\n---\n\nWhen developing Vue components, you can choose between two main approaches: **Options API** and **Composition API**. Both are powerful and support common use cases but have differences that influence how you structure and organize your code.\n\n### Options API\n\n<hr />\n\nThe **Options API** is the more traditional and widely used approach in Vue.js, especially in versions prior to 3.0. With this API, you define the component logic using an options object, such as `data`, `methods`, and `mounted`. The properties defined in the options are exposed within functions via `this`, which refers to the component instance.\n\n**Options API Example:**\n\n```javascript\n<script>\nexport default {\n  // Reactive data exposed through `this`\n  data() {\n    return {\n      count: 0,\n    };\n  },\n\n  // Methods for state manipulation that trigger updates\n  methods: {\n    increment() {\n      this.count++;\n    },\n  },\n\n  // Lifecycle hooks\n  mounted() {\n    console.log(`The initial value is ${this.count}.`);\n  },\n};\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <button @click=\"increment\">The value is: {{ count }}</button>\n</template>\n```\n\n**Advantages of the Options API:**\n\n- **Ease of use:** The Options API is intuitive, especially for beginners, and organizes code in a clear and structured way.\n- **OOP mental model:** Aligns well with an object-oriented mentality, being closer to a class where `this` refers to the component instance.\n\n**When to use the Options API?**\n\n- When you are not using build tools (PWAs) or plan to use Vue primarily for low-complexity scenarios.\n- When clarity and simplicity in code organization are priorities, such as in small projects or for beginners.\n\n### Composition API\n\n<hr />\n\nThe **Composition API** was introduced in Vue 3 and allows you to define component logic using imported functions. In single-file components (SFCs), the Composition API is often used with the `<script setup>` directive, which allows you to write code with less boilerplate.\n\n**Composition API Example with `<script setup>`:**\n\n```javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { ref, onMounted } from 'vue';\n\n// Reactive state\nconst count = ref(0);\n\n// Functions that manipulate the state and trigger updates\nfunction increment() {\n  count.value++;\n}\n\n// Lifecycle hooks\nonMounted(() => {\n  console.log(`The initial value is ${count.value}.`);\n});\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <button @click=\"increment\">The value is: {{ count }}</button>\n</template>\n```\n\n**Advantages of the Composition API:**\n\n- **Flexibility:** Allows the composition of reactive state logic from multiple functions, making it easier to reuse and organize complex code.\n- **Powerful for large applications:** The flexibility and modularity of the Composition API make it ideal for large and complex projects.\n\n**When to use the Composition API?**\n\n- When you plan to build complete applications with Vue, especially using modern build tools.\n- When you need more powerful patterns to organize and reuse logic in complex projects.\n\n### Which to Choose?\n\nBoth APIs have their advantages, and the choice depends on the context and complexity of your project:\n\n- **For learning:** Choose the one that seems more intuitive to you. Most core concepts are shared between the two.\n- **For production:**\n  - Use **Options API** if you are not using build tools or if the project is of low complexity.\n  - Use **Composition API** + **Single-File Components** if you are building complete and complex applications.\n\n### Examples and Comparisons\n\nHere is a comparison between the two APIs using the same component example:\n\n**Options API:**\n\n```javascript\n<script>\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      message: 'Hello Vue!',\n    };\n  },\n  methods: {\n    reverseMessage() {\n      this.message = this.message.split('').reverse().join('');\n    },\n  },\n};\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <p>{{ message }}</p>\n    <button @click=\"reverseMessage\">Reverse Message</button>\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n**Composition API:**\n\n```javascript\n<script setup>\nimport { ref } from 'vue';\n\nconst message = ref('Hello Vue!');\n\nfunction reverseMessage() {\n  message.value = message.value.split('').reverse().join('');\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <p>{{ message }}</p>\n    <button @click=\"reverseMessage\">Reverse Message</button>\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n### General Recommendations\n\n- **For new projects:** Consider starting with the **Composition API** if you plan to scale the application. However, the **Options API** remains an excellent choice, especially for less complex projects.\n- **For those already using the Options API:** There’s no need to migrate immediately to the Composition API, but it’s worth learning and considering for new projects or when additional flexibility is beneficial.\n\nThese topics cover the main differences and uses of Vue APIs, allowing you to choose the approach that best fits your project and level of experience.\n\n## SFC (Single File Components)\n\n<hr />\n\nOne of the great differentiators of Vue is the concept of **Single File Components (SFCs)**. These components combine the template, script, and style in a single `.vue` file, facilitating modularization and code organization.\n\n**Example of an SFC:**\n\n```javascript\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <h1>{{ message }}</h1>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      message: 'Hello Vue!',\n    };\n  },\n};\n</script>\n\n<style scoped>\nh1 {\n  color: blue;\n}\n</style>\n```\n\n## Data Binding\n\n<hr />\n\nVue.js allows for two-way data binding, which automatically synchronizes model data (JavaScript) with the interface (HTML).\n\n**Example:**\n\n```html\n<div id=\"app\">\n  <input v-model=\"message\" />\n  <p>{{ message }}</p>\n</div>\n\n<script>\n  new Vue({\n    el: '#app',\n    data: {\n      message: 'Hello Vue!',\n    },\n  });\n</script>\n```\n\n## Lifecycle Hooks\n\n<hr />\n\nVue.js has a component lifecycle that provides hooks allowing you to execute code at different moments in a component's lifecycle.\n\n**Main hooks:**\n\n- `created`: Called after the instance is created.\n- `mounted`: Called after the instance is mounted to the DOM.\n- `updated`: Called after a reactive update.\n- `destroyed`: Called after the instance is destroyed.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\nnew Vue({\n  el: '#app',\n  data: {\n    message: 'Hello Vue!',\n  },\n  created() {\n    console.log('Component created!');\n  },\n  mounted() {\n    console.log('Component mounted to DOM!');\n  },\n});\n```\n\n## Directives\n\n<hr />\n\nVue.js offers a series of directives that allow for declarative DOM manipulation.\n\n**Some of the main directives:**\n\n- `v-if`: Conditionally renders the element.\n- `v-for`: Iterates over a collection of data.\n- `v-bind`: Binds an HTML attribute to an expression.\n- `v-on`: Binds DOM events to methods.\n- `v-model`: Two-way data binding.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```html\n<div id=\"app\">\n  <p v-if=\"isVisible\">This text is visible.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li v-for=\"item in items\">{{ item }}</li>\n  </ul>\n  <input v-model=\"message\" />\n  <button v-on:click=\"showAlert\">Show Alert</button>\n</div>\n\n<script>\n  new Vue({\n    el: '#app',\n    data: {\n      isVisible: true,\n      items: ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3'],\n      message: 'Hello Vue!',\n    },\n    methods\n\n: {\n      showAlert() {\n        alert(this.message);\n      },\n    },\n  });\n</script>\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\n<hr />\n\nVue.js is a powerful and flexible framework that offers a gentle learning curve and an extensive ecosystem for building applications. Understanding the different approaches and features is essential for developing scalable and efficient applications.\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n- [Official Vue.js documentation](https://vuejs.org/)\n- [Vue.js API Reference](https://vuejs.org/api/)\n- [Vue Router documentation](https://router.vuejs.org/)\n- [Vuex documentation](https://vuex.vuejs.org/)\n\n---\n\nFeel free to modify any sections to better fit your style or add any additional insights you have!"

    "content": "This article comes from a YouTube video titled\n[I learned a system for remembering everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rvey9g0VgY0) by Matt D'Avella, a\nYouTuber focused on productivity content, and Ryan Holiday, described as _\"one of the world's bestselling living\nphilosophers\"_ in his bio on Amazon.\n\nWe will pass through important insights to fix the content you can retain when reading a book.\n\n## How to Read a Book\n\n---\n\nFirst and foremost, we really need to relearn how to read a book. When we are starting out, we often think that reading\na book simply involves spelling out words sequentially, constructing phrases, followed by paragraphs, and eventually\nchapters. However, this approach is perhaps the least effective way to truly absorb and retain the content. It leads us\ndirectly into the pitfall of the [forgetting curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve), which is a topic I\naddress more thoroughly in another article.\n\nReading should be a positive experience, a pleasure. It's not about rushing through the material as quickly as possible.\nNobody boasts, \"Dude, yesterday I had the fastest sex ever, it was awesome.\" If you feel like you're a slow reader and\nwant to pick up the pace without sacrificing comprehension, consider the approach outlined in the book\n[How to Win Friends & Influence People](https://www.amazon.com/-/pt/dp/0671027034/ref=sr_1_1?sr=8-1) (I believe this is\na common feature in all editions of the book, mine being the Portuguese version from Companhia Nacional). Here's how you\ncan read non-fiction books and still extract valuable content:\n\n1. Cultivate a deep and dynamic desire to learn everything the book has to offer. Approach it with a genuine hunger for\n   knowledge and an eagerness to explore its insights.\n\n2. Read each chapter at least twice before moving on to the next one.\n\n3. While reading, take breaks to reflect on how you could apply the content to your own life. Ask yourself, \"Where in my\n   life could I use this information? In what types of situations?\"\n\n4. Highlighting is more crucial than you might think. Pause periodically to highlight any passages that you believe will\n   be useful for future reference.\n\n5. Start journaling. Keep a simple notebook handy and jot down any insights or lessons learned from the book, along with\n   the situations they apply to and the source book.\n\n## How to Take Notes\n\n---\n\nWe often wonder why we should bother taking notes. Initially, it may seem like a tedious task that only prolongs the\ntime it takes to finish a chapter. However, it's essential to understand the purpose behind note-taking. What sets apart\na stored datum from a book and a stored datum that you'll inevitably forget? It's not about hoarding every note and\nrereading them tirelessly or feeling compelled to tattoo information onto our bodies to ensure we won't forget it.\n\nI refer to this concept as the Life Cycle of Information.\n\n![Life Cycle of Information](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/znuxtt86652c2bal9297.png)\n\n**Collect/Create:** This stage involves gathering information either by creating it yourself or collecting it from\nexternal sources.\n\n**Store:** Once collected, information needs to be stored in a way that is easily retrievable and comprehensible. This\nmight involve organizing notes in a systematic manner or utilizing mnemonic devices.\n\n**Use:** Information serves its purpose when it is applied in relevant contexts. This stage involves actively\nincorporating the stored knowledge into decision-making, problem-solving, or creative endeavors.\n\n**Share:** Knowledge gains value when shared with others. Whether through teaching, discussing, or collaborating,\nsharing information enriches collective understanding and fosters collaboration.\n\n**Archive:** As time passes, some information may become less immediately relevant but still valuable for reference or\nhistorical purposes. Archiving ensures that valuable insights are preserved for future use.\n\n**Destroy:** Not all information retains its usefulness indefinitely. Some data may become outdated, irrelevant, or even\nharmful. Knowing when to discard or update information is crucial for maintaining an accurate and manageable knowledge\nbase.\n\n### The Analog vs Digital\n\nIn Matt D'Avella's video, Ryan Holiday suggests favoring the analog path over the digital one, arguing that it allows\nfor a deeper immersion in the content and enhances understanding of the book.\n\nIn this approach, after highlighting key passages in the book, we transfer the important information onto flashcards.\nSubsequently, we revisit and reread the material, organizing it into categories and connections. Employing diagrams or\nmaps can further aid in this process.\n\nHowever, as a software engineer, I believe we could utilize tools like Obsidian and Excalidraw to organize and revisit\nthe content we need to read, along with our note-taking system. Excalidraw could serve as a comprehensive tool for\ncreating diagrams or mind maps, streamlining the digital note-taking process.\n\n## Revisit and Revise\n\n---\n\nAt this point, we understand why we should take notes and how to take them effectively. Now, I feel that this is the\nmost intuitive chapter of this article. Seriously, once you have all your notes, it's faster and more efficient to\nsimply read through them or refer back to the book directly rather than sifting through tiny letters to find the\nspecific chapter you're looking for.\n\n## Give It a Try!\n\n---\n\nNow that you've learned about this system for remembering everything from the books you read, why not give it a try?\nStart implementing the strategies discussed in this article and see how they work for you. By taking notes effectively,\norganizing your thoughts, and utilizing tools like flashcards or digital note-taking apps, you can enhance your ability\nto retain and recall information from the books you've read.\n\nRemember, it's not about completely overhauling your reading habits overnight. Start small, experiment with different\ntechniques, and gradually incorporate them into your routine. Over time, you'll likely find that you're retaining more\ninformation and gaining deeper insights from your reading material than ever before.\n\nSo why wait? Start now and take advantage of the opportunity to remember everything from the books you read—or at least\nmore than before."

    "content": "You don’t need 12 years of school + 4 years of college + 6 years of graduate school to become smart. Seriously, if it took that long, we’d all still be swinging from trees. Genetics? Meh. Habits are what really matter. So, let’s dive in.\n\n## Why Become Smart?\n\nFor what? To get money? To impress people? Any answer works. But first, know yourself and figure out what kind of\napproach you’re willing to take.\n\n## How to Become Smart\n\nMost advice on the internet is as useful as a screen door on a submarine. Socrates himself would have accomplished\nnothing with the internet’s wisdom. Here are some gems:\n\n- Eat fruits\n- Drink coffee\n- Sleep more\n- Take IQ tests\n- Listen to classical music\n\nSounds good, right? But at some point, you actually need to LEARN something.\n\n\"So what can I do to become smart?\"\n\n**Read.** Just this. But it depends on what kind of reading you do and what skills you want to achieve and improve.\n\n- **Fiction books:** More likely to improve your vocabulary than teach you a high-income skill.\n- **Non-fiction books:** You’ll understand more about how the world works in certain areas.\n\n## How to BE Smart\n\nIf we become smart, do we need to correct other people? My answer is yes, but it’s much more important how you do this.\n\nTake this dialogue as an example:\n\n> **Bob:** Crazy how we evolved from chimpanzees, right? **Alice:** Well ACTUALLY, evolution is NONLINEAR, and SEVERAL\n> human-like species inhabited Earth SIMULTANEOUSLY, none of which could even be REMOTELY CONSIDERED as chimpanzees.\n\nHere, Alice just sounds arrogant. So, how can we approach this more politely?\n\n> **Bob:** Crazy how we evolved from chimpanzees, right? **Alice:** It is crazy, right? You know, I was reading the\n> other day that humans and chimpanzees share a common ancestor from 10 million years ago. Since then, we've been\n> evolving separately. I always thought we evolved FROM them, but it turns out we just evolved side by side.\n\nYou can be smart and humble (and also sound like you occasionally touch grass).\n\nThe key is to teach people what you know without making them feel dumb. That way, people actually learn from you, and\nyou’ll be seen as a smart and respectful person.\n\n## Where to Find These Books\n\nYou don’t need to read all five books that everyone tells you to read. Just choose a topic you want to understand. For\nexample:\n\nData Structures: Go on Google and search “data structures book,” then choose the one with the best reviews.\n\nBooks usually cost money, and for legal reasons, I always recommend you buy these books. But you might accidentally come\nacross a website named Library Genesis. You might accidentally search for the title of the book, click on the first\nlink, download a file, and open it in a proper book reader. I’m not responsible for that, feds.\n\n## How to Use What You Read\n\nSo, now you know how to get a book (buying), and you know that this book contains skills and information to use in\nconversation. Good! But how do you actually learn these skills, you ask? I have\n[this other article](https://dev.to/yanpi/how-to-never-forget-mastering-the-art-of-retaining-knowledge-531h) about\nretaining knowledge that will really help you.\n\nBut here are 10 fast tips to know before learning from a book:\n\n1. No practice -> Brain forgets\n2. 20% knowledge -> 80% results\n\nAnd that’s it. It’s the 20% of the list.\n\n## Some Cool Graphics\n\nThis is the [learning curve](https://www.valamis.com/hub/learning-curve):\n\n![Learning curve graph](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hwph3kar4umtqbvtyzhr.png)\n\nAs you can see, the first 20% gets you a lot of progress, but YOU NEED to practice. Books only make you smart if you\ngive your brain a reason to remember them.\n\n\"But can I practice while reading the book?\"\n\nLet’s suppose you’re reading a book about mechanics. You can’t change the battery of your car just because you’re\nreading, right?\n\nIdeally, you should, but you can still practice by imagining the situation. Watch a video of someone doing what you’re\nstudying, visualize yourself taking the same steps, and, if you can, take notes. This way, you’re telling your brain\nit’s something you want to remember instead of just memorizing it.\n\nOur school system is built on this principle. The teacher teaches you a lot of stuff you’ll never use, or if you do,\nit’ll be in 10 years. To get a graduation, the teacher applies a test. If you study and practice, you get good grades;\nif you don’t, you get bad grades. Or, if you’re South Korean, you go to prison (joke—you only go to prison if you\ncheat).\n\nBut now we have a problem: once you’ve taken the test, there’s no need to remember that information. So how can we\nremember something? To answer that, check\n[this article](https://dev.to/yanpi/how-to-never-forget-mastering-the-art-of-retaining-knowledge-531h).\n\n**disclamer**: this article is based on [this cool video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5OJJD3Eytk) from\neasy,actually yt channel"

    "content": "## Introduction:\n\nThe allure of blockchains, spurred by cryptocurrencies and DApps, is undeniable. However, challenges in scalability, performance, and transaction time pose hurdles to widespread adoption. This exploration delves into the intricate correlation between these factors, probing how efficiently blockchains process transactions while ensuring swift confirmations.\n\n## Decoding the Terms:\n\n**Scalability:** A blockchain's capacity to handle increased transactions or users without compromising performance. Crucial for public blockchains, scalability prevents overload during surges in transaction volume.\n\n**Performance:** Reflects the speed and efficiency of transaction processing, typically measured in transactions per second (TPS). Higher performance ensures quicker transactions, enhancing blockchain viability across applications.\n\n**Transaction Time:** The duration for a transaction to be confirmed and added to a blockchain. Varies based on factors like consensus algorithms and network load.\n\n## Our SPECIMENS :\n\n### 1. Bitcoin (BTC):\n\nBitcoin, as the OG, played a fundamental role in popularizing blockchains. However, it faced significant challenges in scalability and performance. Bitcoin boasts 7 TPS with confirmation times ranging from 10 to 30 minutes. Source: [Bitcoin Scalability Problem - ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313503768_Bitcoin_Scalability_Problem)\n\n### 2. Ethereum (ETH):\n\nEthereum pioneered smart contracts but faced scalability issues with Proof of Work (PoW). Transitioning to Ethereum 2.0 and implementing solutions like Lightning Network improved scalability. Average confirmation time: 10-20 seconds. Source: [Ethereum 2.0 - Cornell University](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08966)\n\n### 3. Binance Smart Chain (BSC):\n\nBinance Smart Chain, a parallel to Binance Chain, offers smart contracts with high scalability using Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS). TPS rate exceeds 3,000, and confirmation time is about 3 seconds. Source: [Binance Academy](https://academy.binance.com/pt-br/articles/an-introduction-to-binance-smart-chain-bsc)\n\n### 4. Solana (SOL):\n\nSolana, a high-performance blockchain, achieves over 65,000 TPS with Proof of History (PoH). Confirmation time: approximately 1 second. Source: [CoinCodex](https://coincodex.com/article/24666/solana-tps/)\n\n### 5. Optimism (OPP):\n\nOptimism, an Ethereum scaling solution, uses rollups to increase network scalability. Average confirmation time: around 15 minutes. Source: [Ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/pt-br/developers/docs/scaling/optimistic-rollups/)\n\n### 6. Ripple (XRP):\n\nRipple, focused on international payments, utilizes Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm (RPCA). The XRP Ledger achieves 1,500+ TPS, with a quick confirmation time of 4 seconds. Source: [Ripple](https://www.ripple.com/)\n\n---\n\n## Consensus Methods:\n\nUnderstanding the consensus methods sheds light on how transactions are validated and added to the blockchain. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, influencing scalability and performance.\n\n### 1. Proof of Work (PoW):\n\n**Description:** Proof of Work is a consensus mechanism where network nodes (miners) are Flexing computational muscles in a cryptographic puzzle battle. The first node to solve the puzzle has the right to create the next block on the blockchain and receives a reward in cryptocurrencies. The process requires high computational power and is energy-intensive.\n\n**Advantages:** It is highly secure as it requires a significant amount of computational work to create new blocks, making it difficult to modify previous blocks. Additionally, it is decentralized, as any node can become a miner.\n\n**Disadvantages:** It is slow and has low scalability due to the competition among miners and the time required to solve the puzzle. Additionally, it consumes a large amount of energy, raising environmental concerns.\n\n### 2. Proof of Stake (PoS):\n\n**Description:** Proof of Stake is a consensus mechanism in which validators make bank by staking crypto, and the more you stash, the higher the chance you get to be the blockchain maestro and of being chosen to validate transactions and create blocks. It's an eco-friendly alternative to PoW but can face challenges like the \"Nothing at Stake\" problem.\n\n**Advantages:** It is more energy-efficient compared to PoW as it does not require intensive computational competition. Additionally, it incentivizes active participation of cryptocurrency holders to ensure the security of the network.\n\n**Disadvantages:** There can be a problem known as \"Nothing at Stake,\" where validators may attempt to validate on multiple chains simultaneously without cost, compromising the network's security.\n\n### 3. Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS):\n\n**Description:** DPoS is a variant of PoS where cryptocurrency holders elect representatives called \"witnesses\" to validate transactions and create blocks on their behalf. Witnesses are periodically selected to act as validators.\n\n**Advantages:** Greater scalability compared to PoW and PoS, as witnesses are responsible for creating blocks, reducing competition among network nodes. It is also more energy-efficient.\n\n**Disadvantages:** There may be concerns about centralization, as a limited number of witnesses are responsible for the validation process.\n\n### 4. Proof of History (PoH):\n\n**Description:** Proof of History is an asynchronous consensus mechanism used by Solana. It provides cryptographic proof that an event occurred at a specific time, allowing network nodes to agree on the order of transactions without the need for direct communication between them.\n\n**Advantages:** High scalability and efficiency, allowing nodes to agree on the order of transactions without the need for full consensus among all nodes.\n\n**Disadvantages:** It is not used in isolation as a consensus mechanism but in conjunction with other consensus algorithms like PoS.\n\n### 5. Rollups:\n\n**Description:** Rollups are a second-layer solution designed to improve the scalability of blockchains by aggregating multiple transactions into a single \"rollup\" and recording the proof of these transactions on the main blockchain.\n\n**Advantages:** Increases the processing capacity of the main network, reducing transaction fees and improving efficiency.\n\n**Disadvantages:** There may be a small challenge and response period before transactions are confirmed on the main blockchain, which can lead to longer confirmation times compared to other direct consensus methods.\n\n### 6. Lightning Network (LN):\n\n**Description:** The Lightning Network is a second-layer solution designed to improve the scalability and speed of Bitcoin transactions. It allows the creation of payment channels off the main blockchain, where transactions can be conducted instantly and with very low fees. Only when the channel is closed is the final transaction recorded on the main blockchain.\n\n**Advantages:** Significantly increases the scalability of Bitcoin, allowing a large number of transactions to be processed off-chain. Fast and low-cost transactions.\n\n**Disadvantages:** Requires users to lock funds in payment channels, which can be inconvenient and limit the total value of transactions that can be made.\n\n### 7. Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm (RPCA):\n\n**Description:** RPCA is the consensus mechanism used by the XRP Ledger, Ripple's blockchain. In this method, a group of validators is periodically chosen to validate transactions and create new blocks. Validators are chosen based on a voting process in which they demonstrate their reliability and reputation.\n\n**Advantages:** Allows for high scalability and transaction speed. The XRP Ledger is capable of processing over 1,500 transactions per second with confirmation times of approximately 4 seconds.\n\n**Disadvantages:** Some critics point out that Ripple Labs, the company behind Ripple, has control over the majority of validators, which may raise concerns about the decentralization of the network.\n\n---\n\n## Visa Doesn’t Handle 24,000 TPS and Neither Does Your Pet Blockchain\n\n> Someone mentioned Visa with their magical 24k per second, and it’s stuck ever since.Only that figure isn’t entirely accurate. In fact it’s not even remotely accurate. In reality, Visa processes around 1,700 transactions per second, a figure it rarely exceeds. The larger number is the one that Visa claims, and it’s the one that’s usually referenced in comparison to bitcoin and every other blockchain. In theory Visa should be able to handle that volume – in fact it’s been reported that its servers can handle as much as 56k tps – but that’s all theoretical, much like the claimed throughput of new blockchains that can operate at the speed of light in the lab, but significantly worse in the wild. There’s a big difference between operating a testnet on a bunch of Amazon servers and a mainnet distributed around the globe.\n\n[news.bitcoin.com - Visa Doesn’t Handle 24,000 TPS and Neither Does Your Pet Blockchain](https://news.bitcoin.com/no-visa-doesnt-handle-24000-tps-and-neither-does-your-pet-blockchain/)\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nIn a nutshell, the blockchain journey involves a nuanced dance with three key challenges: scalability, performance, and transaction time. From Bitcoin to Ripple, varied consensus methods like Proof of Work and Delegated Proof of Stake bring their own quirks. Balancing decentralization, security, and efficiency is an ongoing puzzle. As blockchain innovation continues, the quest for the sweet spot between scalability and transaction speed persists. With a mix of research, tech strides, and collaboration, the future holds promise for widespread blockchain adoption across diverse domains."
